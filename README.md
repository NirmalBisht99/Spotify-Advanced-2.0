Spotify-Advanced-2.0
An enhanced, reimagined version of the Spotify web app — built for the Level Up: Vibe Coding Hackathon 2025.
This project introduces innovative features to improve discoverability, interactivity, and personalization for music lovers.

📝 Introduction
Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services globally, but even the best platforms have room for improvement. The goal of Spotify Advanced 2.0 is to enhance the existing Spotify experience with innovative features that make it easier to find music, interact with friends, and personalize your listening experience in a way that Spotify doesn't currently offer.
This app introduces new functionalities that enhance discoverability, provide social features, and offer a more personalized experience.

🎯 Key Features
1. 🔍 Lyric-Based Song Search
Current Issue: Users often remember lyrics from a song but forget the title. Searching for songs using only lyrics can be difficult, and existing options like Genius Integration are limited.
Feature Enhancement: Users can now search for songs by typing partial lyrics, making it easier to discover songs even if the user only remembers a few words.

2. 💬 Chat with Friends
Current Issue: Spotify has minimal real-time interaction between friends beyond shared playlists or activity feeds.
Feature Enhancement: Users can now chat with their friends inside the app — share tracks, suggest songs, and discuss music together. This real-time messaging feature brings a social layer to music streaming.

3. 🎯 Listener’s Pick Mode
Current Issue: Spotify allows users to listen to personalized playlists, but there is no feature that lets users control the music based on their favorite artists for a set duration.
Feature Enhancement: Users can now select specific artists and listen only to their music for a chosen duration. This feature offers more control over the listening experience and caters to fan-driven playlists.

4. 🤖 Mood-Based Chatbot
Current Issue: While Spotify offers personalized playlists and mixes based on listening history, it does not provide music recommendations based on the user's mood.
Feature Enhancement: Powered by OpenAI API, the chatbot can recommend music based on user moods. Simply type something like “I’m feeling chill,” and the chatbot will respond with songs that match that vibe.

5. 📊 Spotify Wrapped Dashboard
Current Issue: The Spotify Wrapped feature is only available at the end of the year and doesn't offer an interactive, real-time experience.
Feature Enhancement: The Wrapped Dashboard now tracks your listening stats throughout the year, offering charts and visuals (powered by Recharts) to show your top artists, songs, and genres — similar to the existing Wrapped feature but continuously updated.
